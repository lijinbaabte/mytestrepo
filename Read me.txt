1) Install node.js (get it from www.nodejs.org)
2) Create a folder anywhere in your system for this project
3) Open visual c++ 2010 command line
      a)change directory to your project folder created in step 2 (using cd command)
      b) then type 'npm install socket.io' and wait for the installation to complete. (don't close this window)
            by this we are installing javascript socket connection plugin for establishing socket connection
4) Copy the node-server/notification/server.js file into your project folder
5) Copy the web folder contents into your web server root
     a) change the ip address I have mentioned in js/myScript.js (line 5) to your server ip
6) Then you are ready to start now...
      
      Go back to command line and type 'node server.js' to start the server that we have created in  server.js

then open the home.html file in your web root folder and enjoy

NB: The port can also be changed , but the thing you have to make sure is change it in both client side and server side.
